I am a PhD candidate / research assistance at the Engineering Systems Laboratory (ESL), MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. My research interest lies in the intersection in between the systems theory and the space systems. My current research topic includes novel theoretical system analysis techniques, and investigation of future space situational awareness systems. I am currently being advised by Professor Olivier L. de Weck.

I was an associate GNC systems engineer at Satrec Initiative, Co. Ltd, a Korean manufacturer of satellite systems for civil and commercial space applications.
At Satrec Initiative, I propeled the development of the Attitude Determination and Control System for Satrec Initiative's Earth-observing satellite systems. 
I was a primary developer of the Flight Control Software for the SpaceEye-X satellite system, which is in orbit since Jul. 2022.

I obtained a master's degree from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. (Spring 2019, Advisor: Professor Min-Jea Tahk)
I also received a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering and Electrical Engineering, with the highest honors. (Spring 2017, Summa Cum Laude) 
During the period, I was also a recipient of the KAIST Presidential Fellowship.
